# Key Insights

From the analysis, several important findings emerged:

• **NPL%** dropped sharply in March (from 9% → 3%), then gradually increased to **10% in August**, mainly driven by **9-month tenor loans**.  
• **Self-employed** and **low-income (<10M/month)** customers show higher default risk.  
• **Northern region** consistently has the highest overdue ratio.  
• **Age group 40–49** records more repayment issues.  
• **Longer-tenor loans** (9–12 months) currently have the highest NPL%, showing greater repayment risk.

# Recommendations

To strengthen portfolio performance and manage risks effectively:

• Tighten **credit approval** for low-income and self-employed customers.  
• Implement **early-warning systems** to detect overdue risks promptly.  
• Provide **restructuring options** for short-tenor borrowers facing repayment pressure.  
• Focus on **risk control** in the Northern region.  
• Offer **loyalty programs** for stable, low-risk office workers.
